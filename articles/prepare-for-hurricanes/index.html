				<p>As a result of global warming, hurricanes will become common in Europe in the next few decades. I discuss the evidence, the impact and the need for proper contingency planning.</p>

<h2>Some terminology</h2>

<h3>Tropical cyclones</h3>

<p>A tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm system with a low-pressure centre, strong winds, and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain. They are called &quot;tropical&quot; because they form almost exclusively over tropical or sub-tropical waters. &quot;Cyclone&quot; refers to their winds moving in a circle, rotating around a central clear eye. The winds blow counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. </p>

<p>For completeness, an anticyclone is a large-scale circulation of winds around a central region of high atmospheric pressure, clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere, counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere&quot;. Anticyclones are not storm systems, and in Belgium, where I used to live, the famous[^1] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azores_High">Azores Anticyclone</a> usually lead to nice weather.</p>

<h3>Storms, hurricanes and typhoons</h3>

<p>The terms &quot;hurricane&quot; and &quot;typhoon&quot; refer both to powerful tropical cyclones. A hurricane[^2] occurs in the Atlantic Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean, and a typhoon[^3] occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean[^4].  The diameter of the hurricane is typically of the order of hundreds of kilometers. Last month&#39;s hurricane Florence was over 600 km in diameter, and typhoon Trami about 500 km. &lt;!-- , The opposite direction of circulation is due to the Coriolis effect. Tropical cyclones typically form over large bodies of relatively warm water. --&gt; &lt;!-- In the south Pacific or Indian Ocean, comparable storms are referred to simply as &quot;tropical cyclones&quot;. --&gt;
A &quot;tropical storm&quot; is &quot;tropical cyclone&quot; that is less strong than a hurricane or typhoon. </p>

<h2>Strength and potential damage</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php">Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale</a> is a scale from 1 to 5 based on a hurricane&#39;s sustained wind speed, used to estimate potential property damage. Hurricanes reaching Category 3 and higher are considered major hurricanes because of their potential for significant loss of life and damage. However, Category 1 and 2 hurricanes are still much more dangerous than ordinary tropical storms, and require preventive measures.</p>

<p>The amount of energy in a hurricane is very large. <a href="http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/D7.html">NOAA</a> (US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) notes that the energy released by an average hurricane &quot;is equivalent to 200 times the world-wide electrical generating capacity&quot;.
&lt;!--
but converting to megatons, a hurricane releases 12,400 megatons of energy per day. For reference, the most powerful US nuclear weapon in active service is a 1.2 megaton bomb.
--&gt;</p>

<p>The table below is adapted from <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php">NOAA</a> page linked above.</p>

<p>|Category|Sustained wind&nbsp;speed|Extent of damage|
|--------|-------------------------|----------------|
|1|119-153 km/h|<em>Very dangerous winds will produce some damage:</em><br>Houses could have damage to roof, shingles and gutters. Large branches of trees will snap and shallowly rooted trees may be toppled. Extensive damage to power lines and poles likely will result in power outages that could last a few to several days.|
|--------|--------------------|--------|
|2|154-177 km/h|<em>Extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage:</em><br>Houses could sustain major roof and siding damage. Many shallowly rooted trees will be snapped or uprooted and block numerous roads. Near-total power loss is expected with outages that could last from several days to weeks.|
|--------|--------------------|--------|
|3|178-208 km/h|<em>Devastating damage will occur:</em><br>Houses may incur major damage or removal of roof decking and gable ends. Many trees will be snapped or uprooted, blocking numerous roads. Electricity and water will be unavailable for several days to weeks after the storm passes.|
|--------|--------------------|--------|
|4|209-251 km/h|<em>Catastrophic damage will occur:</em><br>Houses can sustain severe damage with loss of most of the roof structure and/or some exterior walls. Most trees will be snapped or uprooted and electricity poles downed. Fallen trees and electricity poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.|
|--------|--------------------|--------|
|5|252 km/h or higher|<em>Catastrophic damage will occur:</em><br>A high percentage of houses will be destroyed, with total roof failure and wall collapse. Fallen trees and electricity poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last for weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.|</p>

<p>Note that this table uses <a href="http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/D4.html">sustained wind speeds</a>. The <em>gusts</em> occuring during a tropical cyclone can be a lot stronger than this (typically about 30% stronger), and are usually what is quoted in the media.</p>

<h2>Global warming causes hurricanes to get stronger</h2>

<p>Slightly simplifying, hurricanes get their energy from the heat in the surface sea water. As the planet gets warmer, the sea surface gets warmer, which leads to stronger tropical cyclones.</p>

<p>There is plenty evidence for this trend. For example, very recent work by my friend and colleague Prof. Takemi of the Disaster Prevention Research Institute (DPRI) of Kyoto University [1] used observation data of historical typhoons to reproduce them in simulation, and then simulated the effects of future warmer conditions. They conclude that both wind speed and precipitation would increase significantly. When I visited DPRI in September, a researcher explained me their latest simulations. With 2 degrees warming, wind speeds and rainfall during a typhoon could double.</p>

<p>The recent Guardian article <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/weather/ng-interactive/2018/sep/11/atlantic-hurricanes-are-storms-getting-worse">&quot;Is climate change making hurricanes worse?&quot;</a> provides a good overview. Note that this trend refers to <em>all</em> tropical cyclones, not just these that made landfall.</p>

<h2>Hurricanes are coming to Europe</h2>

<p>Historically, <em>none of the tropical storms</em> in Europe in the last century except <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Vince">hurricane Vince in 2005</a> have been hurricanes, no matter how severe they might have seemed. However, this is about to change.</p>

<p>As hurricanes get more powerful and last longer, the chance that they can reach Europe grows. Again, there is evidence for this. Already in 2013 Reindert Haarsma, Senior Scientist at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute wrote the article <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-future-will-bring-hurricanes-to-europe-16339">&quot;The future will bring hurricanes to Europe&quot;</a> which gives a good overview. The article is based on Haarsma&#39;s scientific research [2]. Other researchers predict similar trends [3,4,5].</p>

<h2>Impact and contingency planning</h2>

<p>Hurricanes do not only cause damage because of the strong winds. They also lead to flash floods because of the very heavy rainfall that they cause (often 30-50 cm/h), and because of the <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/surge/">storm surges</a> which are several meters in height (e.g. 5 m for hurricane Michael a few weeks ago). </p>

<p>To put this into perspective, &lt;!--one of the worst rainfall events and floods in the UK was in 2015, when <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/news/releases/2015/red-warning">rainfall of 5 to 8 cm over 6 to 9 hours was enough to cause a &quot;red&quot; severe weather warning</a> in the north of England. This event was caused by--&gt; in December 2015 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_Great_Britain_and_Ireland_floods">storm Desmond</a> broke the United Kingdom&#39;s 24-hour rainfall record with 34 cm of rainfall in 24 hours, and led to widespread flooding in the UK and Ireland.  The only storm surge on record comparable to those caused by hurricanes was the notorious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea_flood_of_1953">Great Storm of 1953</a>. In Scotland, where storms are common, this was the worst storm[^5] in 500 years.</p>

<!-- currently in Scotland, [the highest storm surge that may occur in a 50-year period raises the sea surface by between 0.9 m and 1.8 m](http://marine.gov.scot/information/ukcp09-projections-sea-level-storm-surges-tides-and-wave-height-change-medium-emissions).-->

<p>Better flood defenses are therefore absolutely crucial to deal with future hurricanes. As a result of the 1953 disaster, much was done in the UK, the Netherlands and Belgium to strenghten flood defenses, but these focus on the North Sea. Similar works on the coasts facing the Atlantic will be necessary. Furthermore because of the increased damage, power outages and disruption of supplies will last much longer than for the storms we have now and therefore contingency plans will have to be put in place. 
A capability for accurate forecasting of hurricane trajectories is necessary for timely evacuation of people in the affected areas.  </p>

<!--Because hurricanes are becoming increasingly frequent in the US and typhoons have always been common from the Philippines to Japan, -->

<p>The good news is that Europe can benefit from the extensive know-how developed for example in the US and Japan, both in predictions and in dealing with the effects of such severe weather events. </p>
