I am a [Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reader_(academic_rank)) in Computing Science at the University of Glasgow. My research interests are compilers and runtime systems for heterogeneous architectures. I am particularly interested in FPGAs and acceleration of climate and weather simulations.
