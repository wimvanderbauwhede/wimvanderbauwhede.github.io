I am Wim Vanderbauwhede, a Professor in Computing Science at the University of Glasgow, where I lead the [Low Carbon and Sustainable Computing](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchthemes/lowcarbon/) activity.

My research is primarily about improving energy efficiency of computation, in particular scientific computing. I research languages, compilers and runtime systems for heterogeneous architectures, novel hardware that has the potential to be more energy efficient if it is programmed well. I am particularly interested in FPGAs and acceleration of climate and weather simulations.
