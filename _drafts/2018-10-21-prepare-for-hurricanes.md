In this post I want to talk about hurricanes. As a result of global warning, these severe weather events will become common in Europe in the next few decades. It is important to understand the impact so that proper contingency planning can be done.

## Some terminology

### Tropical cyclones

A tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by a low-pressure center, a closed low-level atmospheric circulation, strong winds, and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain.

"Tropical" refers to the geographical origin of these systems, which form almost exclusively over tropical seas. "Cyclone" refers to their winds moving in a circle, whirling round their central clear eye with their winds blowing counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.<!-- , The opposite direction of circulation is due to the Coriolis effect. Tropical cyclones typically form over large bodies of relatively warm water. -->

For completeness, an anticyclone is a large-scale circulation of winds around a central region of high atmospheric pressure, clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere, counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere". Anticlones are not storm systems, and in Belgium, where I used to live, they usually lead to nice weather. The "Anticlycone over the Azores" is so famous that it a travel shop in Brussels took it as its name.

### Storms, hurricanes and typhoons

Hurricanes and typhoons refer both to powerful tropical cyclones. A hurricane occurs in the Atlantic Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean, and a typhoon occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. In the south Pacific or Indian Ocean, comparable storms are referred to simply as "tropical cyclones". A "tropical storm" is "tropical cyclone" that is less strong than a hurricane.

<!--
The term "hurricane" derives from the Spanish word _huracán_, which in turn probably derives from the Taino (an indigenous people of the Caribbean) word _hurakán_ "god of the storm".

## Strength and potential damage

The [Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php) is a scale from 1 to 5 based on a hurricane's sustained wind speed, used to estimate potential property damage. Hurricanes reaching Category 3 and higher are considered major hurricanes because of their potential for significant loss of life and damage. Category 1 and 2 storms are still dangerous, however, and require preventative measures. In the western North Pacific, the term "super typhoon" is used for tropical cyclones with sustained winds exceeding 240 km/h. The table below is adapted from the NOAA page linked above.

<table border="0" style="margin:0 auto; padding:10px;">
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th>Category</th>
   <th width="150">Sustained wind speed</th>
   <th>Extent of damage</th>
  </tr>

 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:center;">1</td>
   <td style="text-align:center;">119-153 km/h</td>
   <td>*Very dangerous winds will produce some damage:* Well-constructed frame homes could have damage to roof, shingles, vinyl siding and gutters. Large branches of trees will snap and shallowly rooted trees may be toppled. Extensive damage to power lines and poles likely will result in power outages that could last a few to several days.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:center;">2</td>
   <td style="text-align:center;">154-177 km/h</td>
   <td>*Extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage:*
Well-constructed frame homes could sustain major roof and siding damage. Many shallowly rooted trees will be snapped or uprooted and block numerous roads. Near-total power loss is expected with outages that could last from several days to weeks.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:center;">3<br>(major)</td>
   <td style="text-align:center;">178-208 km/h</td>
   <td>*Devastating damage will occur:*
Well-built framed homes may incur major damage or removal of roof decking and gable ends. Many trees will be snapped or uprooted, blocking numerous roads. Electricity and water will be unavailable for several days to weeks after the storm passes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:center;">4<br>(major)</td>
   <td style="text-align:center;">209-251 km/h</td>
   <td>*Catastrophic damage will occur:*
Well-built framed homes can sustain severe damage with loss of most of the roof structure and/or some exterior walls. Most trees will be snapped or uprooted and power poles downed. Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:center;">5<br>(major)</td>
   <td style="text-align:center;">252 km/h or higher</td>
   <td>*Catastrophic damage will occur:*
A high percentage of framed homes will be destroyed, with total roof failure and wall collapse. Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last for weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.</td>
  </tr>

Note that this table uses [sustained wind speeds](http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/D4.html). The _gusts_ occuring during a tropical cyclone can be a lot stronger than this (typically aboyt 30% stronger), and are usually what is quoted in the media.

If the wind speed is &lt;119 km/h the tropical cyclone is called a (tropical) storm. Historically, _all storms_ in Europe in the last century except hurricane Vince in 2005 are in this category, no matter how severe they might have seemed. However, this is about to change.

## Hurricanes are getting stronger

Slightly simplifying, hurricanes get their energy from the heat in the surface sea water. As the planet gets warmer, the sea surface gets warmer, which leads to stronger tropical cyclones. There is plenty evidence for this, e.g. [this Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/weather/ng-interactive/2018/sep/11/atlantic-hurricanes-are-storms-getting-worse) provides a good overview. Note that this refers to _all_ tropical cyclones, not just these that made landfall.

## Hurricanes are coming to Europe

As hurricanes get more powerfull and last longer, the chance that they can reach Europe grows. Again, there is evidence for this, e.g. [this article by Reindert Haarsma, Senior Scientist at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute ](https://theconversation.com/the-future-will-bring-hurricanes-to-europe-16339) gives a good overview.
